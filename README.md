# CSC-591-Machine-Learning
Project comparing semi-supervised and supervised learning techniques

There are 3 files to run to obtain the results.

1. cotraining.py: Run this file in terminal, ‘python cotraining.py’. This will output accuracy, f-score, precision and recall for each dataset for different amounts of labeled data and different algorithms using Co-Training implementation.

2. EM.py: Run this file in terminal, ‘python EM.py’. This will output accuracy, f-score, precision and recall for each dataset for different amounts of labeled data and different algorithms using EM implementation.

3. main.py: Run this file in terminal, ‘python main.py’.

It will start printing the Accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall for the 3 supervised algorithms and S3VM for different amount of labelled data.

You will need to install:
1. numpy: pip install numpy
2. sklearn: pip install -U scikit-learn
3. pandas: pip install pandas
4. scipy: pip install pandas
